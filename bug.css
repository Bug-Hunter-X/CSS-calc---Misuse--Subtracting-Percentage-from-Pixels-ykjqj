The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly.  It's attempting to subtract a percentage from a pixel value, which is not directly supported.  Browsers interpret this inconsistently, often resulting in unexpected results or layout errors.  For example: `width: calc(100% - 20px);`  works reliably, but `width: calc(200px - 20%);` may not.
